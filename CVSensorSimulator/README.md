# CVSensorSimulator

CVSensorSimulator is a desktop application to simulate a microUSV's onboard sensors using an overhead camera system and [AprilTags](https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag). It requires the OpenCV and Protobuf libraries. The host PC most also be outfitted with a webcam and connected to a wifi network, the same wifi network as any microUSV's being tested. 

The application uses a json config file to which should be modified to reflect a user's setup. 

| Config Field | Type |  Value |
|:---          |:---: |:---    |
| visualize | boolean | Enables or disables the application showing a video feed with labelled tag detections. |
| cameraInfo |  | Camera calibration parameters (can be found using openCV) |
| cameraInfo:cameraID | Integer | Overhead camera's index number on the host PC. This can be found by using the ```v4l2-ctl --list-devices``` command |
| camerInfo:x_res | Integer | camera's x-resolution in pixels |
| cameraInfo:y_res | Integer | camera's y-resolution in pixels |
| cameraInfo:fx | Float | camera's x focal length in mm |
| cameraInfo:fy | Float | camera's y focal length in mm |
| cameraInfo:cx | Float | camera's x center point coordinate in pixels |
| cameraInfo:cy | Float | camera's y center point coordinate in pixels |
| tagsize | Float |  side length of the apriltags in mm (measure the black border) |
| target_hsv_thresh_low:h | Integer | Target detection color threshold lower bound. Hue |
| target_hsv_thresh_low:s | Integer | Target detection color threshold lower bound. Saturation |
| target_hsv_thresh_low:v | Integer | Target detection color threshold lower bound. Value |
| target_hsv_thresh_high:h | Integer | Target detection color threshold upper bound. Hue |
| target_hsv_thresh_high:s | Integer | Target detection color threshold upper bound. Saturation |
| target_hsv_thresh_high:v | Integer | Target detection color threshold upper bound. Value |
| Robots | Integer, String | List of all robots being used and their associated AprilTag ID numbers and labels |
| Waypoints | Float, Float | List of waypoint coordinates to send to each microUSV |
| loop_waypoints | Boolean | Flag indicating if waypoint list should be repeated after each one has been reached |
| output_csv | Boolean | Flag indicating if the application should export the pose history for each robot to a CSV file |

To launch the application, navigate to the CVSensorSimulator binary and execute the following:

```
$ ./CVSensorSimulator [PATH_TO_CONFIG.JSON]
```
